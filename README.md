Elevate in-store customer experience using the Cloud4Wis API that uses location analytics

https://cloud4wi.com/sffw2017-hackathon/

We were asked to find ways to elevate in-store customer experience using the Cloud4Wis API that uses location analytics. 

Our team tried to improve the in-store operations by introducing a new way of shopping while allowing store to capture the customer journey for business intelligence operations. The idea was to move away from having store personnel organize inventory and help the customers instead. 

We created a prototype that allowed shoppers to let stores in a mall know what they were trying to buy. The store would then have these items ready for the shopper and would be able to assist the shopper in addition to keeping track of what the user tried on, what they liked and other such information. Using Cloud4Wis services, the store would know when the user walks into the store and would be able to assist them. They would also be able to know the busiest time of the store, and how many users are online at a given time. A combination of their data and our apps data would give the store a better idea of how to handle customers better.
